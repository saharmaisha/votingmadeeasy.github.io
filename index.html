			<h1 class="hello" style="margin-top: -75px;">Why Vote?</h1>
				<p style="padding: 30px"> Voting is one of the easiest ways for citizens to voice what they need from the government. It is important to keep in mind the policies of the parties when you vote because the laws they pass will have a direct influence on your everyday life. By voting for a particular party you are voting for important issues they believe in such as: <b> college affordability, health care, taxes, climate change, foreign policy, racial inequality, LGBTQ+ rights, worker's rights, reproductive rights </b> and more. Depending on where you will be voting, other governmental positions may be on your ballot.

			<h1 class="hello" style="margin-top: 70px;">Postal vs. In-Person Voting</h1>
			<p style="padding: 30px;"> There are advantages and disadvantages with voting in person. Some of the advantages for voting in person is same day registration for eligibility in voting. Additionally, the ballot is at the voting poll area so <b>there are no hassles regarding obtaining a ballot</b>. The disadvantages of the voting in person are long wait lines due to <b>social distancing</b>. It might not be that long but it might seem long due to the six feet apart regulation. Additionally, this is a federal state but other people might intimidate others to vote for the party that they stand for. This is a <b>rarity</b> but it might still happen.</p>	
			<p style="padding: 30px;"> Just like voting in person, there are advantages and disadvantages with mail in votes. The advantages are no long wait lines, you are able to vote in the comfort of your home with <b>more privacy</b>. The mails could be dropped in a local board of election for it to be counted. The time to vote is more flexible as the ballots are already in your hand, that is why once you get it, you can vote whenever but just before the deadline. There is <b>minimum voter fraud</b> with exceptions. The government saves more money as they are able to have some voter sites open. It saves money paying for places and the workers who will be working on that day. Lastly, it <b>might increase voters</b> due to the fact that there is more time in researching who they would like to vote for.</p>	
			<p style="padding: 30px;"> As for the disadvantages, there are <b>more time constraints</b> for requesting and sending back ballots. You would need to request a ballot earlier and send it back in earlier as well to ensure that you receive a vote, and it gets counted. Some mailing issues <b>might get lost in the transport</b> which can cause some problems. The mails might be missing information to confirm the person so it might be invalidated as well.</p>
